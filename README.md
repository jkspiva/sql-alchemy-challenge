# sql-alchemy-challenge
Module 10 Challenge - SQLAlchemy
-----------------------------------------
In this homework challenge we utilized Python and SQLAlchemy (SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib) in order to do a climate analysis and data exploration of a climate database.

Then Flask was used to create an climate API based on the SQLAlchemy queries that were developed.

*Notes 
- When using the Climate Analysis API, remember to enter the date (in YYYY-MM-DD format) in place of 'start' and 'end' in the URL
- Remember to close your session at the end of your notebook.
